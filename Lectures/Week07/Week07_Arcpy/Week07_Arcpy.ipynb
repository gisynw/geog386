    "- `ArcPy` is a collection of modules, classes and functions which give access to all the geoprocessing tools in `ArcGIS` from within `Python`\n",
    "- Most `geoprocessing` scripts will start with: **import arcpy**\n",

    "### Key features of arcpy\n",
    "- Geoprocessing Tools: Provides access to hundreds of tools, such as buffers, spatial joins, and overlay operations.\n",
    "- Automation: Automates repetitive GIS tasks, like updating feature classes or running models, which improves workflow efficiency.\n",
    "- Spatial Analysis: Supports complex spatial operations like proximity analysis, surface analysis, and spatial statistics.\n",
    "- Data Management: Handles the creation, manipulation, and conversion of spatial data formats (e.g., shapefiles, geodatabases).\n",
    "- Map Production: Helps generate and modify maps by automating tasks such as adding layers, symbols, and exporting maps."
